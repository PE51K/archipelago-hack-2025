## Development guidelines

### Branching policy

- The `main` branch is used for final best performing solution.
- If you want to work on a new feature or fix a bug, create a new branch from `main` with a descriptive name (e.g., `feature/add-new-model` or `bugfix/fix-detection-issue`).
- If you want to run your separate experiments, create a new branch from `main` with a descriptive name (e.g., `experiment/experiment-1`).
- When your work is done, create a pull request to merge your changes into `main`. Ensure that your code is well-documented and tested before merging.

### Code style

- Follow PEP 8 guidelines for Python code.
- Use meaningful variable and function names.
- Write docstrings for all functions and classes.
- Keep your code modular and organized.
